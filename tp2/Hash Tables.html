  3.4   Hash Tables


If keys are small integers, we can use an array to implement a symbol
table, by interpreting the key as an array index so that we can store
the value associated with key i in array position i. In this section, we
consider /hashing/, an extension of this simple method that handles more
complicated types of keys. We reference key-value pairs using arrays by
doing arithmetic operations to transform keys into array indices.

crux of hashing

Search algorithms that use hashing consist of two separate parts. The
first step is to compute a /hash function/ that transforms the search
key into an array index. Ideally, different keys would map to different
indices. This ideal is generally beyond our reach, so we have to face
the possibility that two or more different keys may hash to the same
array index. Thus, the second part of a hashing search is a
/collision-resolution/ process that deals with this situation. Modular
hashing


    Hash functions.

If we have an array that can hold M key-value pairs, then we need a
function that can transform any given key into an index into that array:
an integer in the range [0, M-1]. We seek a hash function that is both
easy to compute and uniformly distributes the keys.

  * /Typical example./ Suppose that we have an application where the
    keys are U.S. social security numbers. A social security number such
    as 123-45-6789 is a 9-digit number divided into three fields. The
    first field identifies the geographical area
    <http://cpsr.org/prevsite/cpsr/privacy/ssn/ssn.structure.html/>
    where the number was issued (for example number whose first field
    are 035 are from Rhode Island and numbers whose first field are 214
    are from Maryland) and the other two fields identify the individual.
    There are a billion different social security numbers, but suppose
    that our application will need to process just a few hundred keys,
    so that we could use a hash table of size M = 1000. One possible
    approach to implementing a hash function is to use three digits from
    the key. Using three digits from the field on the right is likely to
    be preferable to using the three digits in the field on the left
    (since customers may not be equally dispersed over geographic
    areas), but a better approach is to use all nine digits to make an
    int value, then consider hash functions for integers, described next.

  * /Positive integers./ The most commonly used method for hashing
    integers is called /modular hashing/: we choose the array size M to
    be prime, and, for any positive integer key k, compute the remainder
    when dividing k by M. This function is very easy to compute (k % M,
    in Java), and is effective in dispersing the keys evenly between 0
    and M-1.

  * /Floating-point numbers./ If the keys are real numbers between 0 and
    1, we might just multiply by M and round off to the nearest integer
    to get an index between 0 and M-1. Although it is intuitive, this
    approach is defective because it gives more weight to the most
    significant bits of the keys; the least significant bits play no
    role. One way to address this situation is to use modular hashing on
    the binary representation of the key (this is what Java does).

  * /Strings./ Modular hashing works for long keys such as strings, too:
    we simply treat them as huge integers. For example, the code below
    computes a modular hash function for a String s, where R is a small
    prime integer (Java uses 31).

        int hash = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
            hash = (R * hash + s.charAt(i)) % M;

  * /Compound keys./ If the key type has multiple integer fields, we can
    typically mix them together in the way just described for String
    values. For example, suppose that search keys are of type
    USPhoneNumber.java
    <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/PhoneNumber.java.html>, which
    has three integer fields area (3-digit area code), exch (3-digit
    exchange), and ext (4-digit extension). In this case, we can compute
    the number

        int hash = (((area * R + exch) % M) * R + ext) % M; 

  * /Java conventions./ Java helps us address the basic problem that
    every type of data needs a hash function by requiring that every
    data type must implement a method called hashCode() (which returns a
    32-bit integer). The implementation of hashCode() for an object must
    be /consistent with equals/. That is, if a.equals(b) is true, then
    a.hashCode() must have the same numerical value as b.hashCode(). If
    the hashCode() values are the same, the objects may or may not be
    equal, and we must use equals() to decide which condition holds.

  * /Converting a hashCode() to an array index./ Since our goal is an
    array index, not a 32-bit integer, we combine hashCode() with
    modular hashing in our implementations to produce integers between 0
    and M-1 as follows:

        private int hash(Key key) {
           return (key.hashCode() & 0x7fffffff) % M;
        }

    The code masks off the sign bit (to turn the 32-bit integer into a
    31-bit nonnegative integer) and then computing the remainder when
    dividing by M, as in modular hashing.

  * /User-defined hashCode()/. Client code expects that hashCode()
    disperses the keys uniformly among the possible 32-bit result
    values. That is, for any object x, you can write x.hashCode() and,
    in principle, expect to get any one of the 2^32 possible 32-bit
    values with equal likelihood. Java provides hashCode()
    implementations that aspire to this functionality for many common
    types (including String, Integer, Double, Date, and URL), but for
    your own type, you have to try to do it on your own. Program
    PhoneNumber.java
    <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/PhoneNumber.java.html>
    illustrates one way to proceed: make integers from the instance
    variables and use modular hashing. Program Transaction.java
    <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/Transaction.java.html>
    illustrates an even simpler approach: use the hashCode() method for
    the instance variables to convert each to a 32-bit int value and
    then do the arithmetic. 

We have three primary requirements in implementing a good hash function
for a given data type:

  * It should be /deterministic/—equal keys must produce the same hash
    value.

  * It should be /efficient to compute/.

  * It should /uniformly distribute the keys/. 

To analyze our hashing algorithms and develop hypotheses about their
performance, we make the following idealized assumption.


    Assumption J (uniform hashing assumption).

The hash function that we use uniformly distributes keys among the
integer values between 0 and M-1.


    Hashing with separate chaining.

A hash function converts keys into array indices. The second component
of a hashing algorithm is collision resolution: a strategy for handling
the case when two or more keys to be inserted hash to the same index. A
straightforward approach to collision resolution is to build, for each
of the M array indices, a linked list of the key-value pairs whose keys
hash to that index. The basic idea is to choose M to be sufficiently
large that the lists are sufficiently short to enable efficient search
through a two-step process: hash to find the list that could contain the
key, then sequentially search through that list for the key.

hashing with separate chaining

Program SeparateChainingHashST.java
<https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/SeparateChainingHashST.java.html>
implements a symbol table with a separate-chaining hash table. It
maintains an array of SequentialSearchST
<https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/SequentialSearchST.java.html>
objects and implements get() and put() by computing a hash function to
choose which SequentialSearchST can contain the key and then using get()
and put() from SequentialSearchST to complete either job. Program
SeparateChainingLiteHashST.java
<https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/SeparateChainingLiteHashST.java.html>
is similar but does it using an explict Node nested class.

*Proposition K.* In a separate-chaining hash table with M lists and N
keys, the probability (under Assumption J) that the number of keys in a
list is within a small constant factor of N/M is extremely close to 1.
of N/M is extremely close to 1. (Assumes an idealistic hash function.)

This classical mathematical result is compelling, but it completely
depends on Assumption J. Still, in practice, the same behavior occurs.

*Property L.* In a separate-chaining hash table with M lists and N keys,
the number of compares (equality tests) for search and insert is
proportional to N/M.


    Hashing with linear probing.

Another approach to implementing hashing is to store N key-value pairs
in a hash table of size M > N, relying on empty entries in the table to
help with with collision resolution. Such methods are called
/open-addressing/ hashing methods. The simplest open-addressing method
is called /linear probing/: when there is a collision (when we hash to a
table index that is already occupied with a key different from the
search key), then we just check the next entry in the table (by
incrementing the index). There are three possible outcomes:

  * key equal to search key: search hit
  * empty position (null key at indexed position): search miss
  * key not equal to search key: try next entry 

hashing with linear probing

Program LinearProbingHashST.java
<https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/LinearProbingHashST.java.html> is
an implementation of the symbol-table ADT using this method.

As with separate chaining, the performance of open-addressing methods is
dependent on the ratio α = N/M, but we interpret it differently. For
separate chaining α is the average number of items per list and is
generally larger than 1. For open addressing, α is the percentage of
table positions that are occupied; it /must/ be less than 1. We refer to
α as the /load factor/ of the hash table.

*Proposition M.* In a linear-probing has table of size M with N = α M
keys, the average number of probes (under Assumption J) is ~ 1/2 (1 + 1
/ (1 - α)) for search hits and ~ 1/2 (1 + 1 / (1 - α)^2) for search
misses or inserts.


        Q + A.

17. Why does Java use 31 in the hashCode() for String?
 1. It's prime, so that when the user mods out by another number, they
    have no common factors (unless it's a multiple of 31). 31 is also a
    Mersenne prime (like 127 or 8191) which is a prime number that is
    one less than a power of 2. This means that the mod can be done with
    one shift and one subtract if the machine's multiply instruction is
    slow.
17. How do you extract the bits from a variable of type double for use
    in hashing?
 1. Double.doubleToLongBits(x) returns a 64-bit long integer whose bit
    representation is the same as the floating-point representation of
    the double value x.
17. What's wrong with using (s.hashCode() % M) or Math.abs(s.hashCode())
    % M to hash to a value between 0 and M-1?
 1. The % operator returns a non-positive integer if its first argument
    is negative, and this would create an array index out-of-bounds
    error. Surprisingly, the absolute value function can even return a
    negative integer. This happens if its argument is Integer.MIN_VALUE
    because the resulting positive integer cannot be represented using a
    32-bit two's complement integer. This kind of bug would be
    excruciatingly difficult to track down because it would only occur
    one time in 4 billion! [ The String hash code of
    "polygenelubricants" is -2^31. ] 


        Exercises

 5. Is the following implementation of hashCode() legal?

        public int hashCode() {
           return 17;
        }

    /Solution./ Yes, but it would cause all keys to hash to the same
    spot, which would lead to poor performance.

24. Analyze the space usage of separate chaining, linear probing, and
    BSTs for double keys. Present your results in a table like the one
    on page 476.

    /Solution./

      * /Sequential search./ 24 + 48N. A Node in a SequentialSearch
        symbol table consumes 48 bytes of memory (16 bytes overhead, 8
        bytes key, 8 bytes val, 8 bytes next, and 8 bytes inner class
        overhead). A SequentialSearch object consumes 24 bytes (16 bytes
        overhead, 8 bytes first) plus the memory for the nodes.

        Note that the booksite versions uses an extra 8 bytes per
        SequentialSearch object (4 for N and 4 for padding).

      * /Separate chaining./ 56 + 32M + 48N. A SeparateChaining symbol
        table consumes 8M + 56 bytes (16 bytes overhead, 20 bytes array
        overhead, 8 bytes for pointer to array, 8 bytes per reference to
        each array entry, 4 bytes for M, 4 bytes for N, 4 bytes for
        padding), plus the memory for the M SequentialSearch objects. 


        Creative Exercises

32. *Hash attack.* Find 2^N strings, each of length N, that have the
    same hashCode() value, supposing the hashCode() implementation for
    String (as specified in the Java standard
    <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang//String.html#hashCode()>)
    is the following:

        public int hashCode() {
           int hash = 0;
           for (int i = 0; i < length(); i++)
              hash = (hash * 31) + charAt(i);
           return hash;
        }

    /Solution./ It is easy to verify that "Aa" and "BB" hash to the same
    hashCode() value (2112). Now, any string of length 2N that is formed
    by concatenating these two strings together in any order (e.g.,
    BBBBBB, AaAaAa, BBAaBB, AaBBBB) will hash to the same value. Here is
    a list of 10000 strings with the same hash value
    <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/hash-attack.txt>.

33. *Bad hash function.* Consider the following hashCode()
    implementation for String, which was used in early versions of Java:

        public int hashCode() {
           int hash = 0;
           int skip = Math.max(1, length() / 8);
           for (int i = 0; i < length(); i += skip)
              hash = (hash * 37) + charAt(i);
           return hash;
        }

    Explain why you think the designers chose this implementation and
    then why you think it was abandoned in favor of the one in the
    previous exercise.

    /Solution./ This was done in the hopes of computing the hash
    function more quickly. Indeed, the hash values were computed more
    quickly, but it became more likely that many strings hashed to the
    same values. This resulted in a significant degradation in
    performance on many real-world inputs (e.g., long URLs) which all
    hashed to the same value, e.g.,
    http://www.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/34hash/*****java.html.


        Web Exercises

 1. Suppose we wish to repeatedly search a linked list of length N
    elements, each of which contains a very long string key. How might
    we take advantage of the hash value when searching the list for an
    element with a given key? /Solution/: precompute the hash value of
    each string in the list. When searching for a key t, compare its
    hash value to the hash value of a string s. Only compare the string
    s and t if their hash values are equal.
 2. Implement hashCode() and equals() for the following data type. Be
    careful since it is likely that many of the points will have small
    integers for x, y, and z.

        public class Point2D {
            private final int x, y;
            ...
        }

    /Answer/: one solution would to make the first 16 bits of the hash
    code be the xor of the first 16 bits of x and the last 16 bits of y,
    and make the last 16 bits of the hash code be the xor of the last 16
    bits of x and the first 16 bits of y. Thus, if x and y are only 16
    bits or less, the hashCode values will be different for different
    points.
 3. What is wrong with the following implementation of equals() for points?

        public boolean equals(Point q) {
            return x == q.x && y == q.y;
        }

    Wrong signature for equals(). It is an overloaded version of
    equals(), but it does not override the one inherited from Object.
    This will break any code that uses Point with HashSet. This is one
    of the more common gotchas (along with neglecting to override
    hashCode() when you override equals()).
 4. What will the following code fragment print?

        import java.util.HashMap;
        import java.util.GregorianCalendar;

        HashMap st = new HashMap();
        GregorianCalendar x = new GregorianCalendar(1969, 21, 7);
        GregorianCalendar y = new GregorianCalendar(1969, 4, 12);
        GregorianCalendar z = new GregorianCalendar(1969, 21, 7);
        st.put(x, "human in space");
        x.set(1961, 4, 12);
        System.out.println(st.get(x));
        System.out.println(st.get(y));
        System.out.println(st.get(z));

    It will print false, false, false. The date 7/21/1969 is inserted
    onto the hash table, but is subsequently changed to 4/12/1961 while
    the value is in the hash table. Thus, although the date 4/12/1961 is
    in the hash table, when searching for x or y, we will look in the
    wrong bucket and won't find it. We won't find z either since there
    the date 7/21/1969 is no longer a key in the hash table.

    This illustrates why it is good practice to use only immutable types
    for keys in hash tables. The Java designers probably should have
    made GregorianCalendar an immutable object to avoid the potential
    for problems like this.

 5. *Password checker.* Write a program that reads in a string from the
    command line and a dictionary of words from standard input, and
    checks whether it is a "good" password. Here, assume "good" means
    that it (i) is at least 8 characters long, (ii) is not a word in the
    dictionary, (iii) is not a word in the dictionary followed by a
    digit 0-9 (e.g., hello5), (iv) is not two words separated by a digit
    (e.g., hello2world)
 6. *Reverse password checker.* Modify the previous problem so that (ii)
    - (v) are also satisfied for reverses of words in the dictionary
    (e.g., olleh and olleh2world). /Clever solution/: insert each word
    and its reverse into the symbol table.
 7. *Mirroring a web site.* Use hashing to figure out which files need
    to be updated to mirror web site.
 8. *Birthday paradox.* Suppose your music jukebox plays songs from your
    library of 4000 songs at random (with replacement). How long do you
    expect to wait until you hear a song played for the second time?
 9. *Bloom filter.* Support insert, exists. Use less space by allowing
    some false positives. Application: ISP caches web pages (especially
    large images, video); client requests URL; server needs to quickly
    determine whether page is in the cache. Solution: maintain one bit
    array of size N = 8M (M = # elements to insert). Choose k
    independent hash functions from 0 to N-1.
10. *CRC-32.* Another application of hashing is computing /checksums/ to
    verify the integrity of some data file. To compute the checksum of a
    string s,

        import java.util.zip.CRC32;
        ...
        CRC32 checksum = new CRC32();
        checksum.update(s.getBytes());
        System.out.println(checksum.getValue());

11. *Perfect hashing.* See also GNU utility gperf.
12. *Cryptographically secure hash functions.* SHA-1 and MD5. Can
    compute it by converting string to bytes, or when reading in bytes 1
    at a time. Program OneWay.java
    <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/OneWay.java.html> illustrates
    how to use a java.security.MessageDigest object.
13. *Fingerprinting.* Hash function (e.g., MD5 and SHA-1) are also
    useful for verifying the integrity of a file. Hash the file to a
    short string, transmit the string with the file, if the hash of the
    transmitted file differs from the hash value then the data was
    corrupted.

14. *Cuckoo hashing.* Maximum load with uniform hashing is log n / log
    log n. Improve to log log n by choosing least loaded of two. (Only
    improves to log log n / log d if choose least loaded of d.) cuckoo
    hashing
    <http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/2007/06/cuckoo-hashing-theory-and-practice-part.html>
    achieves constant average time insertion and constant worst-case
    search: each item has two possible slots. Put in either of two
    available slots if empty; if not, eject another item in one of the
    two slots and move to its other slot (and recur). "The name derives
    from the behavior of some species of cuckoo, where the mother bird
    pushes eggs out of another bird's nest to lay her own." Rehash
    everything if you get into a relocation cycle.

15. *Covariant equals.* CovariantPhoneNumber.java
    <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/CovariantPhoneNumber.java.html>
    implements a covariant equals() method.

16. *Last come, first served linear probing.* Modify
    LinearProbingHashST.java
    <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/LinearProbingHashST.java.html> so
    that each item is inserted where it arrives; if the cell is already
    occupied, then that item moves one entry to the right (where the
    rule is repeated).

17. *Robin Hood linear probing.* Modify LinearProbingHashST.java
    <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/34hash/LinearProbingHashST.java.html> so
    that when an item probes a cell that is already occupied, the item
    (of the two) with the larger current displacement gets the cell and
    the other item is moved one entry to the right (where the rule is
    repeated).

18. *Indifference graph.* Given V points on the real line, its
    indifference graph
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indifference_graph> is the graph
    formed by adding a vertex for each point and an edge between two
    vertices if and only if the distance between the two corresponding
    points is strictly less than one. Design an algorithm (under the
    uniform hashing assumption) to compute the indifference graph of a
    set of V points in time proportional to V + E.

    /Solution./ Round each real number down to the nearest integer and
    use a hash table to identify all points that round to the same
    integer. Now, for each point p, use the hash table to find all
    points that round to an integer within one of the rounded value of p
    and add an edge (p, q) for each pair of points whose distance is
    less than one. See this reference
    <http://11011110.livejournal.com/287956.html> for an explanation as
    to why this takes linear time.
